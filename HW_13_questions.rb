# 1. Write a script that takes user input and passes it to a method as an argument and then displays it into the following concatenated string.

 

#     #"Hello (name).  Nice to meet you."
# def hello2 name2  
#   'Hello ' + name2  
# end  
# puts(hello2 'Mandy')  



# visited = []
# state = gets. chomp.upcase
# if state != 'done'
# 	visited.push (state)
# end
# end


# 	puts "Name all the states you have visited. Type done when you're done!"

# response = gets.chomp.downcase

# 	puts "#{response}"
	


# while response.downcase != "done"
# end
